## Features

- Document upload for verification
- Hash generation and storage on the blockchain
- Verification of document integrity

## Technologies Used

- React: Front-end user interface
- Alchemy Blockchain API: Interact with the Ethereum blockchain
- Web3.js: Ethereum JavaScript library
- MetaMask: Ethereum wallet and browser extension
- Node.js: Backend server for interacting with the blockchain
